# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Encoding of the categorical variables, spliting into training and testing datasets, and standardization have been applied to the features.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

The model accuracy is under 75% in the initial analysis and in all attempts. Several variables were modified in three attempts to optimize performance of accuracy through neuron and layer changes, data set tabular data and epoch adjustment. 

### Optimization
  
## Summary
The deep learning model did not reach the target of 75% accuracy rating.  
Reasons could account to the overfitting of the model, or limited variables for the prediction.  
Recommend a Randomn Forest Classifier to compare outcome to the deep learning model.
